    <h1>Hey,</h1>

    <p>
    What you are reading is a text in a web-page that is being shown by your browser.
    The reason why you are reading this that you have probably typed in your address bar
    or clicked a link somewhere else that brought you to <a href="https://js.bagrat.io">js.bagrat.io</a>,
    which expectedly happens to host this web-page.
    </p>

    <p>
    The reason why <em>you</em> visited this web-page is only in your own brain,
    but what I can definitely tell you, is the reason <em>I</em> made this web-page.
    </p>

    <p>
    At some point in my programming career I had to learn JavaScript. I started with an online
    course <a href="">"JavaScript Essential Training"</a>. If you know Richard Feynman, then you
    most probably also know that the best way to learn well is to try to teach the topic to someone else.
    That is exactly what I am going to try to do here.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are still reading this, then you are probably still interested in learning JavaScript.
    Your background does not really matter if you want to learn just out of fun, curiosity or basic
    professional needs. However, if your intentions spread further into full-time professional area
    then you will need some more relevant fundamental material to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another enabler of effective learning is understanding why you are learning something and where you
    will be able to apply it. The advanced stage of learning and practice is applying the tools you
    learn productively. Initially JavaScript was invented to program web-pages and make them more
    dynamic.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have already used the term "web-page" 3 times in this web-page. Now 5. And before we even try to
    understand what does it mean to program a web-page with JavaScript, we first need to understand and
    agree on what the <strong>Web</strong> is.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <strong>Internet</strong> is the <em>technology</em> that enables multiple computers to talk to
    each other while being geographically distributed inter-connected over physical network.
    The <strong>Web</strong> is another layer of abstraction on top of the Internet, being a set of
    documents inter-connected via links, i.e. a web of documents.
    </p>

    <p>
    Simply put, Some computers on the internet have names, like <code>google.com</code> and <code>wikipedia.org</code>.
    When you enter the computer name in the address bar of your browser, the browser talks to that computer and asks
    it to send back the document named <code>index.html</code> in the root directory of the computer. If you want another
    document, you can specify the name of the desired document using a slash (/) like this:
    <code>js.bagrat.io/another-document.html</code>
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, if we take the computer named <code>js.bagrat.io</code>, typing in the address bar <code>js.bagrat.io</code> or
    <code>js.bagrat.io/index.html</code> will return the same document, which is <code>index.html</code> on computer
    <code>js.bagrat.io</code>. You might have noticed the <code>.html</code> suffix multiple times already. Don't worry,
    we will talk about it soon.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now this <code>index.html</code> is just a single document. I authored and put this document on the <code>js.bagrat.io</code>
    computer. Since I control this computer, I have also put another document to demonstrate the web to you.
    That other document is next to the <code>index.html</code> document in the root directory, named <code>the-web.html</code>.
    So if you remember the slash (/) you have just learnt about you might have already guessed that the
    address of that document in the Web is <code>js.bagrat.io/the-web.html</code>.
