    What you are reading is a text in a web-page that is being shown by your browser.
    The reason why you are reading this that you have probably typed in your address bar
    or clicked a link somewhere else that brought you to <a href="https://js.bagrat.io">js.bagrat.io</a>,
    which expectedly happens to host this web-page.
    </p>

    <p>
    The reason why <strong>you</strong> visited this web-page is only in your own brain,
    but what I can definitely tell you, is the reason <strong>I</strong> made this web-page.
    </p>

    <p>
    At some point in my programming career I had to learn JavaScript. I started with an online
    course <a href="">"JavaScript Essential Training"</a>. If you know Richard Feynman, then you
    most probably also know that the best way to learn well is to try to teach the topic to someone else.

    If you are still reading this, then you are probably still interested in learning JavaScript.
    Your background does not really matter if you want to learn just out of fun, curiosity or basic
    professional needs. However, if your intentions spread further into full-time professional area
    then you will need some more relevant fundamental material to learn.

    Another enabler of effective learning is understanding why you are learning something and where you
    will be able to apply it. The advanced stage of learning and practice is applying the tools you
    learn productively. Initially JavaScript was invented to program web-pages and make them more
    dynamic.

    <p>
    I have already used the term "web-page" 3 times in this web-page. Now 4. And before we even try to
    understand what does it mean to program a web-page with JavaScript, we first need to understand and
    agree on what the Web is.
