      <p>
      What you are reading is a text in a web-page that is being shown by your browser.
      The reason why you are reading this is that you have probably typed in your address bar
      or clicked a link somewhere else that brought you to <a id="link0" href="https://js.bagrat.io">js.bagrat.io</a>,
      which expectedly happens to host this web-page.
      </p>

      <p>
      The reason why <em>you</em> visited this web-page is only in your own brain,
      but what I can definitely tell you, is the reason <em>I</em> made this web-page.
      </p>

      <p>
      At some point in my programming career I had to learn JavaScript. I started with an online
      course <a id="link1" href="">"JavaScript Essential Training"</a>. If you know Richard Feynman, then you
      most probably also know that the best way to learn well is to try to teach the topic to someone else.
      That is exactly what I am going to try to do here.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you are still reading this, then you are probably still interested in learning JavaScript.
      Your background does not really matter if you want to learn just out of fun, curiosity or basic
      professional needs. However, if your intentions spread further into full-time professional area
      then you will need some more relevant fundamental material to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another enabler of effective learning is understanding why you are learning something and where you
      will be able to apply it. The advanced stage of learning and practice is applying the tools you
      learn productively. Initially JavaScript was invented to program web-pages and make them more
      dynamic.
      </p>

      <p>
      I have already used the term "web-page" 3 times in this web-page. Now 5. And before we even try to
      understand what does it mean to program a web-page with JavaScript, we first need to understand and
      agree on what the <strong>Web</strong> is.
      </p>

      <p>
      The <strong>Internet</strong> is the <em>technology</em> that enables multiple computers to talk to
      each other while being geographically distributed inter-connected over physical network.
      The <strong>Web</strong> is another layer of abstraction on top of the Internet, being a set of
      documents inter-connected via links, i.e. a web of documents.
      </p>

      <p>
      Simply put, some computers on the internet have names, like <code>google.com</code> and <code>wikipedia.org</code>.
      When you enter the computer name in the address bar of your browser, the browser talks to that computer and asks
      it to send back the document named <code>index.html</code> in the root directory of the computer. If you want another
      document, you can specify the name of the desired document using a slash (<code>/</code>) like this:
      <code>js.bagrat.io/another-document.html</code>
      </p>

      <p>
      For example, if we take the computer named <code>js.bagrat.io</code>, typing in the address bar <code>js.bagrat.io</code> or
      <code>js.bagrat.io/index.html</code> will return the same document, which is <code>index.html</code> on computer
      <code>js.bagrat.io</code>. You might have noticed the <code>.html</code> suffix multiple times already. Don't worry,
      we will talk about it soon.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now this <code>index.html</code> is just a single document. I authored and put this document on the <code>js.bagrat.io</code>
      computer. Since I control this computer, I have also put another document to demonstrate the web to you. That other document
      is next to the <code>index.html</code> document in the root directory, named <code>the-web.html</code>. So if you remember
      the slash (<code>/</code>) you have just learnt about you might have already guessed that the address of that document
      in the Web is <code>js.bagrat.io/the-web.html</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>BUT WAIT!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
      Before you rush to type the address of the document in the address bar of your browser (which would work, please try it later),
      let me recap.
      </p>

      <p>
      Again, the Web is a set of documents inter-connected via links. We have seen document addressess like <code>js.bagrat.io/index.html</code>
      and <code>js.bagrat.io/the-web.html</code>. We haven't yet seen the contents of the <code>the-web.html</code> document,
      but what you are reading right now is the contents of the <code>index.html</code> presented by your browser. We will
      get back to this later, back to the point now. So documents, are just pieces of information, for simplicity,
      consider text like this document. But then what about links by which the documents are inter-connected in the Web?
      </p>

      <p>
      A link is simply reference in one document to another document in the Web. When I have the address of my other document
      in this one, it is also logically a reference to <code>js.bagrat.io/the-web.html</code>. However, if you write the
      reference in a special way, about which we will talk soon, the browser makes it handy for the reader to navigate using
      those links. So instead of typing the adrees in the address bar, you just click on the reference or link for short.
      </p>

      <p id="linkDemo">
      You have actually already seen a couple of links in this document...
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you remember where?
      </p>

      <div id="linkDemoNav">
        <p>(click "Yes" or "No" below)</p>

        <button onclick="transition('linkDemo_Scroll')">Yes</button>
        <button onclick="transition('linkDemo_Scroll')">No</button>
      </div>

      <p>
      That's right! Those blue words, <a>like these</a>, are links to other documents in the Web. When you see them in the browser, you can just click
      on them, and the document they reference will be shown by your browser.
